# WebRTC adapter #
[adapter.js] is a shim to insulate apps from spec changes and prefix differences. In fact, the standards and protocols used for WebRTC implementations are highly stable, and there are only a few prefixed names. For full interop information, see [webrtc.org/web-apis/interop](http://www.webrtc.org/web-apis/interop).

## Install ##
```bash
meteor add webrtc-adapter
```
